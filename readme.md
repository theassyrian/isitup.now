# Credits
- IsItUp.Now is basically a remake of [isitup.org](https://github.com/sjparkinson/isitup.org) in Node.js, using Express. 
- It was developed as part of my Node.js learning experience. I have uploaded the code with the intention of helping out others who are also trying to learn the node environment.
- Most of the styling was adapted from [Evil Rabbit](https://twitter.com/evilrabbit_)'s [front site](https://github.com/evilrabbit/front).
